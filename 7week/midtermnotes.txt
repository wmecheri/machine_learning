Modeling

simplified representation of reality:
- make prediction when direct measurment difficult
- understand variable relationships
- derive insights
- optimize decisions based on predicted outcomes

Types of models (right model depend on problem, data available and need for interpretability)
- Deterministic = outcome precisely determined, known relationship (Y = f(X)) (correlation)
- Probabilistic = randomness in prediction (Y = f(X) + e) (linear regression)
- Parametric:
    - specific functional form
    - simpler but may miss complex patterns (linear regression)
    - clear hypothesis about variables relationship 
- Non Parametric: 
    - no specific functional form
    - more flexible but require more data (decision tree)
    - want to discover complec patterns without strong assumptions

f(X) systematic relationship between X and Y
- crucial to accurately estimate = reliable prediction / inference
- even when perfect, still have some error because of e

Types of Error:
- Reductible: imperfect modeling, reduced by improving model
- Irreductible: inherent randomness, cannot be eliminated

More complex:
- can capture intricate patterns
- migh be offer higher accuracy
- might be less interpretable
- too complex = overfitting, captures noise rather than underlying pattern


AI

simulation human intelligence by machines:
- learning: acquiring information / rules
- reasoning: use rule reach approximate / definite conclusion
- self correction: improving system's accuracy overtime

Statistical models (linear regression):
- use equation to represent relationship, probability
- used to infer relationship / predict outcomes based on historical data
- relies on assumption about data distribution (normal distribution)
- involves closed form mathematical solution
- used for both prediction / inference

Machine learning model
- subset of AI, systems which learn / make decision based on data
- require large amout of data
- focus more on prediction accuracy than inference
- data-driven approach that often doesnt require explicit programming
- supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning paradigms
- can handle complex / high dimensional data

Deep learning model
- subset of ML, use neural network with layers to learn representation of data
- effective in handling unstructured data (image, audio, text)
- composed of multiple layer of neuron, learn and extract more and more abstract features
- require large amount of data and computional power
